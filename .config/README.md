## Files and Directories

### `user-dirs.dirs`

I hate system default directories such as `~/Desktop` and `~/Music`.

This file sets your default directories (except for `Downloads`) to be same as
your home directory.
It does not delete them but changes their system default destinations and
removes them from sidebar in the file manager.
If you want to delete them, you need to do manually.

### `nvim/`

Configuration files for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
